   - G0 is the "average" of all sound recordings over the last 5 days (44-46)
   - Gi represents the "average" for each individual day
   - The distances show how much the sound patterns vary or move

1. **The Top Graph (Blue Line - Distance between G0 and Gi)**:
   - Shows how far each day's center (Gi) is from the selected center cluster (G0)
   - Extreme variability during the Poor Cooling period (Days 2-13)
   - After the repair on Day 14, the distances stabilize below the G0 average line, except for day 23
   - First gas replenishment at day day 7 and next replinishment & repair at day 14
   - The pink shaded region shows the potential poor cooling period. 

2. **The Bottom Graph (Red Line - Distance between Gi and Gi+1)**:
   - Shows how much the sound pattern changes from one day to the next
   - Very large day-to-day changes during the Poor Cooling period, peaking at 0.23 units
   - Post-repair (after Day 14), consecutive days stabilize below the average for consecutive days

3. **Observations**:
   - Clear identification of 3 phases:
     1. Initial operation (Days 1-2)
     2. Poor Cooling period (Days 2-14) marked by high variability
     3. Post-repair stability (Days 15-45)
